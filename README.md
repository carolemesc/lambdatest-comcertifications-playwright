## Install Gitpod:

```The best way to get see the power of Gitpod, is to try it out by starting your first Workspace.

To start your first workspace:

- Navigate to a GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repository.
- Open the repo in Gitpod by prefixing the URL with: gitpod.io/#.
- Confirm the workspace creation.
```

- Install the browser extension
  - A convenient way to work with Gitpod is using our browser extension. Using the extension you can open workspaces directly from inside GitHub

- Gitpodify a project
  ```- Gitpod uses a .gitpod.yml file located at the root of your repository to unlock all benefits. It defines the processes to start for your project (e.g. a database or webserver), installs the required tools, editor extensions or IDE plugins. To get started:

  - Add a .gitpod.yml at the root of your repository.
    - You can use gp init to quickly generate the .gitpod.yml file.
  - Use the gp validate command to validate your configuration is working.
  - Commit and push to apply the configuration for all subsequent workspace starts.
  - Every opened workspace will now run the steps defined in your gitpod.yml.
  ```
